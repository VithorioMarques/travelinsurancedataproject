**Case Study Project - Travel Insurance**

Congratulations, you have just landed your first job as a data  analyst at Travel Assured! Travel Assured is a travel insurance company. Due to the COVID pandemic, they have had to cut their marketing budget  by over 50%. It is more important than ever that they advertise in the  right places and to the right people.

Travel Assured has plenty of data on their current customers as well  as people who got quotes but never bought insurance. They want to know  if there are differences in the travel habits between customers and  non-customers - they believe they are more likely to travel often  (buying tickets from frequent flyer miles) and travel abroad. They would be interested in any other insights you can find that might help the  marketing strategy.
